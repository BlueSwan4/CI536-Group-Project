# CI536 GROUP PROJECT SUBMISSION - A GENERIC FANTASY RPG
--------------------------------

This is the GitHub repository for the software artefact produced for the University of Brighton's CI536 "Integrated Group Project Module". Our chosen software artefact was a top-down 2D turn-based RPG.
The demo for the artefact can be found here: (TODO: ADD DEMO FOOTAGE LINK).
If you wish to play the demo yourself, a windows build is available under the "Releases" section of this repository. For ease of use, a .unitypackage is also available for codebase inspection.
